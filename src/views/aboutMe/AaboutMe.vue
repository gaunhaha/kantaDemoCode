                I possess a strong curiosity for new technologies and often take the initiative to self-study in my
                spare time. I am optimistic and have high self-expectations, able to incorporate and unify my
                colleagues' opinions while offering suggestions as needed. I enjoy teamwork, and I am proactive and
                responsible in my work.

                In my role as a software engineer, I believe my strengths lie in quickly understanding requirements and
                swiftly formulating effective solutions. I excel at transforming complex logic or concepts into clear,
                comprehensible text or visuals, which I then further break down into structured to-do lists. This
                approach helps me proceed with development in an organized manner, ensuring each step has clear
                objectives and timelines, ultimately enabling me to complete projects efficiently and accurately to meet
                requirements.
